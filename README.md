# Image_Classification
In this project, I classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. I preprocess the images, then train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on all the samples. The images are normalized and the labels are one-hot encoded. I build  convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. In the end, I use the neural network to make predictions on the sample images.
